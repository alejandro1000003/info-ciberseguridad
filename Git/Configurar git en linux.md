## SSH keypair setup for GitHub (or GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket, etc, etc)

### Create a repo.
Make sure there is at least one file in it (even just the README.md)

### Generate a SSH key pair (private/public):
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
```
**or even better:**
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

It also possible to use ed25519. There are pros and cons, but personally I've had some issues and that is the reason I've chosen to stick to 4096 rsa for now.

### Copy the contents of the public SSH key

GNU/Linux (requires the xclip package):
```
xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
Windows Command Line:
```
type %userprofile%\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | clip
```
Git Bash on Windows / Windows PowerShell:
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip
```

or of course copy it via your favorite editor, cat, or whatever suits your needs :)

### Copy the public SSH key to GitHub
Copy the contents of the to your SSH keys to your GitHub account settings (https://github.com/settings/keys).

### Test the SSH key:
```
ssh -T git@github.com
```

Change directory into the local clone of your repository (if you're not already there) and run:
```
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/your-repository.git
```

Now try editing a file (try the README) and then do:
```
git add -A
git commit -am "Update README.md"
git push
```

**(Cada vez que hagas un push tienes que añadir la clave)**
Add the key to the ssh-agent
```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

You should not be asked for a username or password. If it works, your SSH key is correctly configured.
